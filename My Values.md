## My painful experiences

### 0-10 years old
- Bullied because I was fat and had [[TOC]]
- My parents always complaining we didn't have enough money, but I got expansive toys from my grandmother
- I was one of the last - if not the last - to be allowed to write in cursive letters in my class
- I didn't understand math at all. It was very hard for me and I felt like I was dumb
- My best friend's dad died
- [[@ Gabriel Hamdan]] built an imported building toy with real bricks without permission
- Got lost in a Mall
- By being jealous of how a friend played football, I pushed him in a game and he went head first into a wall and started bleeding
- A boy died on a beach we're in while in vacation at Iriri
- I couldn't swim properly
- Realize one day my parents would die
- Sleep at some friend's house and had to ask my parents to pick me up late at night because I was afraid.
- I stole two small toys from a bookstore and regretted

### 10-15 years old
