[[Mycelium]] technology can replace plastic in many ways.

Plastic is always made of polymers and it has made our lives easier. But it's cheaper to make new than to recycle. Now, it's one of the most problematic environmental pollution.

Mycelium is the root of the mushroom while the part we eat is the flower.

Mushrooms are notorious to recycle nutrients and grow easily and quickly. If you give the mycelium a framework, it will grow around it. This is how you can make fungus bricks.

It's a great insulator, biodegradable and resistant. Also, it's cheap to make.

Some interesting companies investing in this:
- Magical Mushroom
- Paradise packaging
- Grown bio
- Biofab

Also, the food industry is using it to replace meat, as the fibers on the mycelium look like meat fiber.

The clothing industry is also using it to replace leather and plastic.

Mycelium is heated to kill the mushroom before shipping, that way it doesn't keep growing over time.

In the construction industry, it can be used as an insulator for both heat and sound. It's safer and less expansive.

Wearable technology is also being used as it can be used in sensors and circuits.

It's a growing market and opportunity.
