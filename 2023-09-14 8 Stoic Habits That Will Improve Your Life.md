Foundational [[Habits]] are the most important aspect to succeed. We need rules and guides to live our lives.

8 foundational stoic habits:
1. Prepare for the hours ahead - Journaling
2. Go for a walk - time for the mind
3. Commit to [[Consistensy]] 
4. Engage with your community - care about the world
5. Push your limits - We always have a bit more to give - have an [[Endurance]] practice
6. Cherish your loved ones - don't take time or people for granted - enjoy people now while we can
7. Read, read, read
8. Repeat this phrase: [[Memento Mori]] (remember that I will die) - put things on perspective - good or bad things, everything pales in comparison.


> All Growth is on the other side of [[The Resistance]]
