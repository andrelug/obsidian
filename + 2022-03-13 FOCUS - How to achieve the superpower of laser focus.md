There is always many things to do, but prioritizing is what matters.

There are 'false urgencies', which normally are demands from other people. We put these things ahead and end up squeezing our life projects in between.

Basic framework:

1. Decide what matter most
2. Decide when will you do what matters most
3. Squeeze all other things around it
4. Schedule the time for what matters most - ahead of the time

Schedule the best times of your productive days to the most important tasks that will push you forward. You must Defend the zone.

**Make the time for that and squeeze the rest to to side. Or let it slip and deal with the consequences**.

To be able to do that:

1. Schedule the work prior to the day
2. Just do the work when the time comes. No need to wait for the right mindset or inspiration.
