If you want something in your live you have to understand the frequency of that and change the body's frequency to attract it.

How it really works:
1. [[Visualization]]
	1. Concise choice of positive words
	2. Clear visualization
	3. Feeling (most important component)
2. Match the frequency of what we want to be in alignment
3. Concentration
	1. Science: Clear steps you need to take to work towards a goal
	2. [[Art]]: Requires repetition and practice
	3. We need to control our concentration and decide where it goes, not jump around when something comes up
4. [[Routines]]
	1. We need rituals all day long


We become good on what we practice. So if we practice something negative all the time, we become good at it. Like distraction. **Most of us have mastered the art of distraction**. Imagine practice something for 10 or more hours per day.
