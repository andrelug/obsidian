There are some people who are always a pleasure to be around and there might be a secret to those people.

First we have to understand their [[Mindset]]

There are two types:

- Fixed:
	- Believe we are what we are and things don't change.
- Growth
	- Constant evolution. We're always changing and can work hard to change our situations and characteristics

It's not always binary and we switch depending on the occasion and situation.

How we value our worth differs depending on our mindset.

- Fixed:
	- Judge him/herself against others. To be good at something, needs to be better than someone
	- Fear of failure and shy away from challenges
	- [[Arrogance]]
- Growth
	- Feels successful when is learning
	- Welcome challenge

In relation to others

- Fixed:
	- Enjoy other's mistakes
	- Smirk when we slip-up
	- Restrict our growth
	- They are forced in a perpetual cycle of self-reference
	- Because they judge, others tend to be less prone to share things with them because they feel threatened 
- Growth:
	- Makes others feel comfortable to explore and show weakness
	- Free to engage
	- Are more able to connect with others
	- They have more [[Empathy]]
	- They feel happy for our success as there is no competition involved in the relation

There are some fundamental questions that may move us towards a fixed mindset, such as:
- Are we good enough?
- Am I likable?

And in a way, fixed minded people are the most afraid and insecure about themselves and deep down seek the love and admiration of others most. And by striving to connect in this way, they end up achieving the opposite.

These mindsets are contagious, so many times one person starts with a more fixed mindset and people around also go in the same way. Similarly, we can shift a group's mindset by starting to adopt a growth mindset.

- Take yourself less seriously because your imperfections are the things that people can really connect with
- Learn to laugh at yourself
- Be the student, not the teacher
- Don't worry to fuck things up much
