Most people are distracted all the time. Entertainment and [[Social Media]] are more important than [[Learning]] and creating things.

>> Entertainment and distractions is the enemy of creation and learning. They will keep you in [[Mediocrity]].
>> ~ [[@ Benjamin Hardy]]

[[Income]], [[Relationships]] and [[Success]] are determined by your learning. You are defined by the length of your struggle. Most successful people are lifelong learners.

It's not a degree, but [[Self-education]].

>> We attract into our lives what we are
>> ~ Benjamin Hardy

We need to become the person that will attract and be able to succeed on our goals.

>> The problem is that our culture has engaged in a Faustian bargain, in which we trade our genius and artistry for apparent stability
>> ~ [[@ Seth Godin]]

>> Every day, check these 4 boxes: Have I improved 1% on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health?
>> ~ [[@ James Altucher]]

We need to take control of our success by choosing learning and growth everyday instead of entertainment and distractions. Not only that, but also choose positive and like-minded people to be around.

Most people will never do this, so the competition is very low.
