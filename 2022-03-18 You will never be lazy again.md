Social media companies make their apps to be addictive and [[Dopamine]] releasing machines.

There are four primary [[Brain wave]] stages:
1. Beta - awake
2. Delta - sleep
3. Theta  - just before and after sleep - [[Creativity]] state. Showers are good to get into this stage
4. Alpha - relaxed awareness - [[Meditation]] state. Television puts us in this stage. In a trance.

Theta and Alpha states are important for [[Learning]]. You can learn faster when you are in the alpha stage and we can put ourselves in these states.

In school we should be learning how to learn, but this doesn't happen. How to remember and recall information.

>> There is no learning without remember
>> ~ [[@ Socrates]]

In the morning, we are in this special state, but then we pick up the phone and use social media. And this have some bad effects and rewires the brain:

- The dangers of the world and negativity - this will decrease [[Productivity]] and [[Performance]]
- Train us to be distracted
	- [[Meditation]] is important here to train our brain to return whenever distracted


People often use phrases like:
- I hope I have creativity, energy, focus, memory, etc today
but those aren't things you have, they are things you do. you don't have love, you do loving things. you don't have energy, you do things that will give you energy. etc

There is a process for getting into any mental state.

There is a learning curve, but also a forgetting curve. In 48h,  80% of what you've learned is gone. That's why [[Memory]] is so important.

**Don't touch your phone until you get at least one important thing done in the day**.

It doesn't have to be perfect, but it's a constant progress.

A thermostat sets the temperature and changes the environment, not just react to it.
