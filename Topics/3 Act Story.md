> ACT 1

## HOOK - 1% mark

### Introduction to character's world

The hook pulls the reader into the story before they are emotionally involved in anything. The hook introduces the character's world and everyday life, while also revealing that something is off. The hook is the first five minutes (the first chapter). It should answer these questions:

-   Whose story is this?
-   What's happening here?
-   What's at stake?

The hook makes you want to keep reading.

## INCITING INCIDENT - 12% mark

### Call to action

This is the event that really sets the story in motion. Something changes, something throws the protagonist outside their confort zone. A conflict surfaces - something the protagonist has to face head-on.

## FIRST PLOT POINT - 25% mark

### Pivotal moment / see where this is going?

The protagonist is forced to engage with the story, either out of necessity or by choice. Protagonist makes a decision which determines what will happen next. They must act now or risk far greater consquences. This is the first pivotal moment of the story.

> ACT 2

## PRE-MIDPOINT REACTIONARY HERO - 25%-50% mark

### Protagonist is in survival mode

After the first plot point, the protagonist is on a journey - propelled by fear, necessity, or both. The protagonsit has a goal, but something is going to stand in their way. But before the real conflict steps in, the protagonist is simply reacting to whatever happened in the first plot point.

## GAME-CHANGING MIDPOINT - 50% mark

### Plot twist!

Here we arrive at the story's midopint - game-changing turn of events. This is the moment when the protagonist realizes the truth and her worldview/goal experiences a shift. Challenge begins.

## POST-MIDPOINT ACTION HERO - 50%-62% mark

### Protagonist makes a decision

Thanks to the game-changing midpoint, the protagonist has to switch gears when it comes to their goal. They may be intimidated by conflict, but at this point, they are actively pursuing it, instead of reacting to avoid it. The stakes are raised because of the protagonist's decision, and although they has more to win, they also have more to loose.

> ACT 3

## SUPPOSED VICTORY - 62%-75% mark

### Protagonist thinks he has overcome

The protagonist is now a man or a woman with a plan, thanks to the decision they made at the end of act 2. They are feeling confident they will be victorious. Or perhaps they have overcome the smallest and feel pretty good about their plan. Little do they know, disaster is on the way. (NOTE: This plot point is optional)

## DISASTER - 75% mark

### Didn't see that coming, did you?

Didn't see that coming, did you? This is the part where something (or everything) goes wrong. It's kind of a plot twist on it's own way, because though the reader might have see it coming, the protagonist must certainly did not.

## DARK MOMENT - 80% mark

### Protagonist is hopeless

The protagonist feels lost and hopeless in wake of the disaster. As the climax nears, the protagonist realizes there is no escape from their situation. It's do-or-die! However, the dark moment isn't always a result of the antagonit's actions. Sometimes the "dark moment" can be simply: confusion, disapointment, betrayal, or heartbreak.

## RECOVEY - 85% mark

### Renewed hope

As the protagonist recovers from the disaster, they question their choices, commitment to their goal, and their own abilities. The protagonist has to overcome their false beliefs in order to continue to the climax, thus developing as a character.

## CONFRONTATION - 88% mark

### Protagonist faces biggest challenge

The protagonist faces the biggest challange of all. This is the confrontation with the antagonistic force, be that a person, element of nature/technology, or an internal issue (or all three!). This will be the climax that everyone is waiting for.

## VICTORY - 90% mark

### Protagonist overcomes

The protagonist overcomes and achieves their goal! This may or may not include defeating the bad guy. The protagonist must fight for victory and we should all be freaking out when they succeed.

## RESOLUTION - 100% mark

### Wrapping up loose ends

This is the part where all loose ends are tied up. The reader should be left with no missing information or silent questions. If the book is not a standalone, then some questions can be left unanswered, but don't make things so confusing that it kills the excitement.

> PROCESS

1.  Copia essa estrutura para um novo documento
2.  Faz um short outline da hist√≥ria. 3 a 5 mil palavras. Layout geral de cada parte da hist√≥ria
3.  Faz um long outling explicando melhor alguns pontos. Algo tipo 15 a 20 mil palavras.
4.  Tenta pensar no 'plot problem': The plot problem isn't just the external conflict. The plot problem is essentially the obstacles your protagonist has to overcome that will force her to face her fears but ultimately lead her to the truth.
5.  Pensa nos sub-plots: What character they are associated with.
6.  Pesnar na causa e efeito (o que acontece e suas consequ√™ncias) de cada ato, cena, parte do livro.
