**Locus of control** is the degree to which people believe that they, as opposed to external forces (beyond their influence), have control over the outcome of events in their lives.

Individuals with a strong internal locus of control believe events in their life are primarily a result of their own actions: for example, when receiving exam results, people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities. People with a strong external locus of control tend to praise or blame external factors such as the teacher or the exam.
