## Remember the kanji

A way to learn japanese [[Kanji]] faster. 

It was developed by [[@ James Heisig]] and published on three books to learn a total of 3007 kanji.

The principle behind the method is to use english words to describe the kanji instead of japanese ones. That way it makes it easier to learn.

The order the kanji are taught is also different, trying not to get the most used ones first, but rather learning basic kanji first and later others that are built with the basic ones.

There are a few steps to learn:
1. Learn the stroke
2. Learn the meaning
3. Memorize the kanji with a story
