According to Tony Robbins, we all have 6 basic human needs:

1. **Certainty**: assurance you can avoid pain and gain pleasure  
2. **Uncertainty/Variety**: the need for the unknown, change, new stimuli  
3. **Significance**: feeling unique, important, special or needed  
4. **Connection/Love**: a strong feeling of closeness or union with someone or something  
5. **Growth**: an expansion of capacity, capability or understanding  
6. **Contribution**: a sense of service and focus on helping, giving to and supporting others

These drive and shape all of our emotions, actions, quality of life, and destinies.

Any dysfunctional behavior arise form the inability to consistently meet these core needs.

## 1 Certainty
This first need relates to safety and stability. It can be a stable job, how comfortable we are with our bodies or a relationship. 

It's connected to:
- Our ability to avoid pain and gain pleasure
- Our search for security and comfort
- Our own survival instinct

Positive paths we can take to suffice this need:
- Master a skill
- Search for reliable information
- Have faith
- [[Self-confidence]]

Negative paths this need can take you if not addressed:
- Alcohol and drugs
- [[Procrastination]]
- Try to control others
- Lower expectations
- Excess eating

A neutral way to attend to this need is money. It's neutral because it can lead to safety, but also lead to [[Anxiety]] and fear to lose the money.

## 2 Uncertainty / Variety
This need is related to change in life, surprise, challenge and novelty. When we face uncertainty we expand our life views and grow. This need normally arises when we are safe.

Positive paths we can take to suffice this need:
- Seek new goals
- Let us face new challenges
- [[Travel]]
- Read good [[Books]]
- Watch nice [[Movies]]
- Start a new project

Negative paths this need can take you if not addressed:
- Excess eating
- Alcohol and drugs
- Have an affair

## 3 Significance
This need relates to being recognized by others and status. Our wish to be original, to stand out and be different. Maybe even to be part of an exclusive group.

Positive paths we can take to suffice this need:
- Help other people
- [[Contribution]]
- [[Teaching]] your special abilities
- Be an example to others

Negative paths this need can take you if not addressed:
- Violence
- Arrogance
- Try to control others

Neutral paths:
- Style
	- speaking
	- dressing
	- humor
- Money


## 4 Connection / Love
This need transcends a couple's relationship and actually relates to the love between people, family, friends. We need to feel connected to other people, animals and the planet. It can also relate to our [[Self-love]] or [[Spirituality]].

Positive paths we can take to suffice this need:
- Intimate relationships
- [[Friendship]]
- Walk in nature
- Praying

Negative paths this need can take you if not addressed:
- Addictions
- Gambling
- Violence

## 5 Growth
This is our need to always be learning new things, evolving, changing, expanding, and becoming a better human being. 

Positive paths we can take to suffice this need:
- Learn new things
- Study
- Reading

No bad paths here.

## 6 Contribution
The last need relates to helping others, giving away, serving and making a difference in other people's lives. During our lives, we received love, safety, learning and much more, so we have a natural wish to give it back.

This need is also related to the desire to leave something behind or make a dent in the universe. A legacy.

Positive paths we can take to suffice this need:
- Teaching
- Donate time, attention and/or money
- Take care of the environment
- Be an example to others

Also no negative paths here.


## Conclusion
Certainty, uncertainty, meaning and connection are the four basic needs of our personalities. We can fulfil them and still don't feel satisfied because we also need to attend the two supreme needs: Growth and Contribution.
