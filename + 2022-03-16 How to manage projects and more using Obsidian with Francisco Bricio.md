In this video Francisco shows his Obsidian setup. What really interested me is how he organizes his [[_focus]] and made me want to copy how he did it.

1. Who am I?
2. What do I Want?
3. Why do I that these things?
4. When I'm going to do those these?
5. What are the things I will consistently do to accomplish these?
6. With Whom I'm going to surround myself for leverage?
7. Where will I do this; which tools I use?
