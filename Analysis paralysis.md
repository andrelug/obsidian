The situation that occurs when we are paralyzed by the large amount of choices and possibilities. We feel overwhelmed and this leads us to overthink too much and a decision or action is never made.

Naturally, when we reach this point we feel anxious and the problems accumulate. At the same time, we spend a lot of our [[Willpower muscle]] and it makes doing other things in life difficult.

Sometimes, this feeling arises from the need to make the perfect decision.

>>"Analysis paralysis is when the fear of either making an error or forgoing a superior solution outweighs the realistic expectation or potential value of success in a decision made in a timely manner."

Enhance [[Decision making]] abilities improve our capacity to decide faster and more reliably, ignoring the unknown possible results of other choices that were not made.
