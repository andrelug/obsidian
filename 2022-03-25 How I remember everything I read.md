Most things we read are lost after a few days, weeks and months. [[Memory curve]]

There are 7 levels of reading expertise.

## Level 1

When we just read and not engage much with the material. Read loads of books and hope we will learn something by osmosis.

This is good for fiction, but not to non-fiction.

## Level 2

Read and highlight things that resonate with you.

## Level 3

Use Readwise

## Level 4

Get all highlights to a central location

## Level 5

All up until now was very passive, but now it's time to review.

Take quick notes from the stuff you have read. Have a quick summary template getting:
- Top 3 highlights
- Description of the book in three topics or sentences
- How it changed me
- What I liked most

## Level 6

More than all above, add a summary and notes about the book. Re-phrasing things just to make sure we have understood and to better remember.

Publish your detailed notes if you have a blog.

## Level 7

[[Zettelkasten]] method. Turn literature notes to ever-green notes (permanent notes).
