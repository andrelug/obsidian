This is a framework to better understand where should I go, which projects to take and how to better understand myself.

1. [[Who]] am I?
2. What do I [[Want]]?
3. [[Why]] do I that these things?
4. [[When]] I'm going to do those these?
5. [[What]] are the things I will consistently do to accomplish these?
6. With [[Whom]] I'm going to surround myself for leverage?
7. [[Where]] will I do this; which tools I use?


All that must be aligned and connected to the my [[Principles]].
