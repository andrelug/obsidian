## What is a Personal Knowledge System?
A way to organize knowledge for personal purposes and make sense of the world.

Our ancestors used many ways to organize and maintain knowledge. In [[Buddhism]], we have the [[Eightfold Path]]. In [[Stoicism]], they had the [[Four Vurtues or Stoicism]].

PKM is also a way to help us remember more of what we learn.

Sometimes we discover an idea that we feel like it can change our lives. But then, we forget it as we are bombarded with new things all the time - this is bad PKM.

Good PKM means to connect things, remember and make sense of the world from these ideas.

The goal is to be a **Note Maker** and not a **Note Taker**


PKM helps you think:
- Critically
- Creatively
- Connectively
...all at the same time.

And from that place, you can contribute more to the world.
