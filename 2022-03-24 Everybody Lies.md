## Summary


## Chapter 1

What’s in it for me? Find out what’s hiding behind the big data curtain.

Let’s face it – no matter how true to ourselves and those around us we claim to be, to some extent or another, we still lie. Whether it’s inflating our benevolent characteristics in a survey about our lifestyle or not telling the full story about the sorts of weird stuff we do when no one is looking, everybody practices a bit of deceit in his day-to-day life. But with the increasingly vast amounts of data that are collected through, for instance, Google searches, we can go beneath the surface and see the truth. With such an impossibly large accumulation of data on countless aspects of human existence, a pool of information collectively known as big data, it is now possible to analyze revealing patterns in our behavior and identify preferences that we never knew about before. In these blinks, you’ll learn about what big data has to offer, from reporting on the state of our health, to revealing strange human quirks, to helping conduct endless randomized, controlled experiments. You’ll also discover what kinky preference some women have that involves apples; how big data reveals the cities in which the American dream lives on; and whether big data should be used to prevent suicide

## Chapter 2

[[Data science]] is more intuitive than you think.

You’ve heard the term, but what exactly is big data? The clue is in the name. Big data refers to an immense volume of data. A volume that’s so vast, in fact, that the human mind can hardly comprehend it. In other word, big data is data for which computational power is required to recognize patterns. Paradoxically, however, despite its remarkable scale, data science has an intuitive aspect to it. After all, if you think about it, we’re all data scientists in a way. The author points to his grandmother. One Thanksgiving, she started suggesting to the author what his ideal partner should be like – at least as far as she was concerned! The partner needed to be clever, nice, funny, sociable and pretty (though no supermodels needed apply). At 88, his grandma had seen plenty of relationships come and go. She was using years of information and data gathering to articulate the characteristics she saw as essential in successful relationships. She was utilizing information to spot patterns and predict how certain variables would impact one another – just as a data scientist would. However, although data science is an intuitive process, intuition itself isn’t actually science. That’s why utilizing gathered data correctly is essential to refining one’s worldview.

Data provides us with the material to confirm or rebut our initial gut feelings. It helps us identify more precise patterns and predictions than personal experience alone ever could. Let’s return to grandma; she was convinced that relationships last longer if partners have mutual friends. This notion was based on her own experience, as she and her husband had spent many an evening with their friends in Queens, New York. But in reality, her sample size was too small and the hard data suggests that she was mistaken. A 2014 study by Lars Backstrom and Jon Kleinberg, based on Facebook data, showed couples with more friends in common were more likely to change their relationship status from “in a relationship” to “single.” This goes to show that though a gut feeling may get us far, data refine even the most intuitive person’s perspective.

## Chapter 3

[[@ Google]] is a good example of how big data can constantly provide new information.

Data science is a useful tool. But what makes it special is not the amount of collected data, but rather that the data is useful; in other words, it’s the kind of data that can reveal patterns or make predictions. Google is a case in point. Larry Page and Sergey Brin’s search engine, founded in 1998, became such a giant not simply because they were able to collect lots of data. Rather, what set Google apart was that the collected data could be used efficiently. Before Google, when you typed “Bill Clinton” into a search engine, you’d just be given websites that contained the phrase most frequently. Often you’d get a load of irrelevant hits. Brin and Page’s algorithm worked differently. They figured out that a website was likely more relevant to someone if it had more links from other sites that took a user to it. So, Bill Clinton’s official White House website, which was the target of thousands of links, would be more useful than, for example, a site with only a hundred links, even though it might mention him by name more often. They aggregated all that data about links and were able to spot patterns and predict what information was most relevant to the user. In the following blinks, we’ll explain four reasons why big data is so powerful. Google’s approach is a good example of the first reason: big data is entirely novel. It offers us a constant stream of new information. Before the days of big data, you had to wait for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect and calculate the current unemployment rates by way of phone surveys, or wait for a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to learn about infection rates for certain illnesses. But now, you could potentially use Google's big data to track both of these – and that’s exactly what Google engineer Jeremy Ginsberg did. He showed that flu-related Google searches, such as “flu symptoms,” indicate of the spread of influenza, and can be used to track the spread of the disease across geographical areas and over time.
