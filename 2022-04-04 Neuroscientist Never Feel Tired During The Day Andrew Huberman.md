Sometimes during the day we feel sleepy, but there is a trick to make you awake without coffee.

When we are sleepy our eyelids close and our shins move down.

When we look up creates a wakefulness in the brain, so you can improve alertness just by looking with eyes open for 10 or 15 seconds.

When looking down (phone, computer, etc) makes us sleepy. So positioning the screen above eye level or around it makes is more alert.
