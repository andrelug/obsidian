A mental model is a pattern in reality that shows up again and again. Once you recognize one, it starts to pop-up everywhere. Understand how it works, and you can recognize something deep about the universe.

## 1 The Margin

![[1-margin-v2.png]]

We think in averages, but reality works on margins.

[[Marginal benefits]] tend to experience [[Diminishing returns]]. Eating the twentieth piece of cake isnâ€™t as good as the first.

[[Marginal costs]], in contrast, can often decline. Writing the twentieth essay takes less effort than the first, because it gets easier with practice.

The mistake is to think in averages. We ask how much it was in the past, rather than asking how much the next one will likely be.

## 2 Natural Selection

In a way, this mental modal relates to how something can either spread or die depending on how well fit it is to its environment. Good mutations overtime prevail over original ones and each time it gets better to its purpose.

## 3 Signaling

![[3-signaling.png]]

Why is hotel bedding white? Why do we pay more for medicine than prevention? Why would most people rather have credentials than an education? The answer is [[Signaling]].

Sometimes, we make fake signals on our culture, which end up also being adapted and spread.

Although some kinds of signaling are suspicious, it appears to be something embedded into our [[Psychology]] at a very basic level.

## 4 Potential energy

![[4-potential.png]]

Things fall down. Potential is a physical concept that extends the notion of height. A ball high in the sky has gravitational potential. Let it go and it will fall down.

This means that many things that will go up or gain a certain energy or height will probably fall down.

## 5 Compounding

![[5-exponential.png]]

[[Exponential growth]] is both rare and incredibly powerful.

What makes compounding work is when the rate of growth depends on the amount you already have. Money compounds because each dollar you already have contributes interest. Bunnies left unchecked multiply exponentially because each pair creates more bunnies.

We arenâ€™t built to think in terms of exponential growth. When it occurs, weâ€™re often taken by surprise.

## 6 Bayes' Rule

![[6-Bayes.png]]

This rule relates to the use of known information you already have to better understand a problem - normally probabilistic problems.

Sometimes the first intuitive answer we have to statistical problems are not correct because we don't fully comprehend how statistic works.

In the image example:

There are 10,000 people being tested for a disease and only one people have it. The test for the disease is 99% accurate.

If someone takes the test and it's positive, what's the likelihood the patient has the disease?

99%?

No. Because if the test is 99% correct, it means 1% of 10 thousand will be positive, which is 99 people. If only one people is positive, then 98 of 99 tests will still be wrong.

## 7 Common Knowledge

![[7-common.png]]

Common knowledge are the things everybody knows. But not just that, theyâ€™re the things everybody knows that everybody knows. Even more, everybody knows that everybody knows that everybody knows. Repeat ad infinitum and you have common knowledge.

The best illustration of common knowledge is in The Emperorâ€™s New Clothes. The emperor is naked and everybody knows heâ€™s naked. But because itâ€™s not common knowledge that heâ€™s naked, so everybody plays along and acts like heâ€™s dressed fabulously. It takes an innocent child to speak aloud what was already in everybodyâ€™s minds.

Common knowledge matters because it can create stable points around arbitrary decisions. Money, for instance, is valuable because everybody agrees it has value. If the value of money werenâ€™t common knowledge, it wouldnâ€™t work as [[money]].

## 8 Feedback

![[8-feedback-v2.png]]

Feedback is just one pattern in a broader collection of [[Systems thinking]].

Systems thinking applies to neuroscience, molecular biology, politics, economics and far more. The idea is that abstract flows of information can lead to complex behavior that analyzing the parts alone couldnâ€™t predict.

Feedback can come in two flavors: positive and negative. Negative feedback is when an output dampens its own input. The result is stability. Positive feedback is when the output amplifies the input. The result is an explosion that depends on the starting point.

Much of our behavior is governed by negative feedback. Youâ€™re hungry, you eat and feel less hungry. You work really hard, feel satisfied and take a break. But other loops are positiveâ€”success can bring confidence, which brings more success. Fear can lead to avoidance, which reinforces anxiety. Knowing which can make a huge difference.

## 9 Incentives

![[9-incentives-v3.png]]

Suppose we added a new event to the Olympics. It was part 100-meter dash, part beauty pageant. Now imagine that, regardless of how fast they run, the winners were always the best looking.

If such an event existed, would you be surprised if you observed that the contestants spent most their time on cosmetics and hairstyling, and little time on actually running?

This example is silly, but analogous situations exist in the real world. Professors are overwhelmingly judged on their research output, not their teaching ability. Is it any wonder then, that even for ruinously expensive universities, lectures are often uninspired?

Using this mental model involves backwards reasoning. Given what we see people do, what can we guess about the incentives that guide them? Better to notice this in advance, before you start training for a race that wonâ€™t matter.

## 10 Nash Equilibria

![[10-nash.png]]

A Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, is a stable strategy for a multiplayer game.

Stable strategies mean that, knowing what everyone else is doing, you donâ€™t want to do something different. An unstable strategy is, knowing what everyone else is doing, you want to change how youâ€™ll play.

The Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma is an example of an (unfortunate) Nash equilibrium. Snitch and youâ€™ll get out of jail free, but your partner in crime will rot in prison. Keep quiet and youâ€™ll both get a light sentence. The problem is that the good outcome (keeping quiet) is unstable. Regardless of what your opponent chooses, your best bet is to snitch.

Nash equilibria explain why social change is hard, even if everybody agrees. If polluting is easier than not, and the cost of pollution is shared, the Nash equilibrium is for everyone to pollute. This is true, even if everyone would rather live in a world without pollution.
