This book is a detailed analysis of how Nioklas Luhmann organized his notes and were able to produce an enormous amount of content (books and papers).

To be a powerful thinker and come up with original insights, there is a process to it.

Takeaways
- Writing is thinking:
	- The process of writing is a powerful way of thinking. So you don't need to think before you write.
	- Instead of just copying some content when studying, you want to write in your own words and distil it down. You want to own it.
- Value of an external system
	- He uses the system called [[Zettelkasten]]. He'd write small notes about concepts and organized it into a system and link them.
	- There is too much content for us to remember everything, so we need an external system to hold this data to be easily accessible.
	- By linking them, we contextualize the ideas.
	- Three types of notes:
		- Fleeting note
			- just to write thoughts and quick things
		- Literature note
			- notes you take while reading some content
		- Permanent note
			- the ideas and notes you want to keep them on your system
			- here you build your permanent database
- Superiority of the emergent approach
	- As you are taking the notes and linking them, the content emerges
	- So following any interest, you go ahead and make the content about it
