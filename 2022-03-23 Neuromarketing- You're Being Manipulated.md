We see thousands of ads everyday and there is a method behind them to make us want to buy stuff we don't even want.

There are some manipulations that we all know like:
- Placing the more common items in the end of the store, closer to the checkout, so you have to go through the entire store looking at stuff until you get to the ones you need. Like having milk in the back of the store.
- Buy one get two
- Billboards and ads

But our psyche is being heavily studied to understand our patterns and predict customer's choices before the customer is aware of them. This is neuromarketing.

It starts with how we perceive things, which is relative and not absolutely. So our perception is based on stimulus that is already present.

An example is when you turn your phone's screen on in a bright environment. Nobody is going to notice it. But if you do it in a dark movie theater, it looks very bright. Although the brightness is similar, our perception of the it is very different.

Another example is with sound. If we are in a loud environment, the addition of another sound - like glass cheering - will not represent much of a difference. But the same sound in the middle of the night appears to us to be very loud.

This relative perception is called [[Weber's Law]] and has been the principle in [[Astronomy]] and [[Music Theory]] - areas that deal with how we perceive things.

And now it has a new application, the perception of price.

1. Whenever the price of a product goes up or down, how the customer feels about that price change depends on the original price of the commodity. Companies can use this information to marginally keep increasing the price of a product over iterations, provided that they do so in increments that are just below our **perception threshold**.
	1. This is more prominent in markets where people also perceives the price of products based on how much disposable income they have.
2. In a study, before people get to bid on how much they would pay for a specific product, they were asked to tell the last three digits on their social security number. People with higher numbers bid higher. This is called [[Anchoring]]. This might be the reason why counters are used in fast food chains - normally with high numbers counting to let customers know their turn, but also to encourage them to pay just a bit more.
	1. Anchoring is used as well launching a product with a high price, to exhaust the enthusiasts willing to pay for it. But then drop the price and call it an opportunity. iPhone example.
3. When companies put their prices at 99 or 199 is not just about the idea of feeling like it's a digit less. 199 is like 100 and something, not 200. But also because we tend to think the fair price of things a whole number below what's priced, so you'll have much happier customers charging them one dollar less than the 'would be' correct number.
4. **We like relative improvements**, so stores will put products they know won't sell well close to others to make these others seem more desirable. Marketing decoys. This is why many times we have tiers of plans when purchasing a online subscription. And normally we have a very shitty option that is there just to make the others look better.
5. Other interesting tweaks
	1. They increase the font of products they want to sell more. Barely noticeable, but subconsciously it registers as being more worthy or our attention.
	2. Offer slightly better options online, but not overwhelm with choices - Amazon example
	3. Olfactory association - sensation of smell - is also used to make you remember. Familiarity. McDonalds example. New-car smell. A way brands use to make it recognizable.

We have less control over our purchasing habits than we would like.

>>We buy things we don't need, to impress people we don't like, and the things you own, end up owning you.
