[[Dean Keith Simonton]] researched high achievers' minds in search of what made them successfull.

## Backtrack
Expertise, [[problem solving]] and specialization are not enough.

The special ability is to backtrack to an older strategy or try new ways when things are going too slow. It's ignore [[Sunk-cost bias]].

Sometimes the best way to move forward is to go back to an earlier idea, sketch or plan. Go back and find new ways forward. Especially when progress is haulted.


## Hobbies
Those involved in hobbies achieve more in their carreers than those who doesn't.

> "Creative achievement is strongly associated with openness to new experiences. Such openness brings that extra stimulation that is necessary to breakthrough ideas."
> ~ [[Robert Bernstein]]

## Subtract
People tend to solve problems by adding more then subtraiam. Features in a product, government policies, reforming education, etc.

But what happens is that subtracting is sometimes better (space X example reutilizing only one rocket).
