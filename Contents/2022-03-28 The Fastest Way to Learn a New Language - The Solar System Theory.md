The traditional way language learning is taught is not good. But there are better ways.

How he visualize language learning:

## 1 Understand how languages work, apart from the language itself.

1. Some words are used much more frequently than others, so we need to rank the words
2. Each language is different and the 10% more used words may be different as well depending on the goal or need. If you want to be a chef, the 10% more used words might be related to the cooking aspect.
3. There are more languages on the 10% more used than in the rest [[Pareto principle]]
