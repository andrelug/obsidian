We all have met people who appear to have their shit together and are doing great. At the same time, also we have met people who appear to be buried on a hole and are unable to get out of there - stuck and negative.

It's hard to point out one unique thing determine whether or not you will go to each site of the spectrum.

But there is one belief that are more often than not attributed to successful people, which is:

- Successful people tend to have an internal [[Locus of Control]] and unsuccessful people tend to have an external one

If we have an external or internal locus of control, probably it came from our childhood and how we grew up.

Children have an external locus of control, as they depend on others for most everything. The situations on life are out of their control. And that's ok.

But maybe this child have a mentor-like person on their lives who taught them to be independent. How to cook, to clean, to make money, etc.

But unfortunately, many of us bring this child-like mentality to into adulthood and still think that we depend on other people, government, boss, provider, etc.

"The government/boss/partner is making my life difficult for this and that reason."

Many of these complaints, in the end, are valid complaints. They have logic. But the default shouldn't be to blame others or the current environment around for things that don't go the way we'd like. **The default should be to look at the cards we are given and take full responsibility of how we play those cards**.

Internal locus of control is very important nowadays.
