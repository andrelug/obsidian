Many of us don't know exactly what to do to move our lives forward right now. And sometimes the problem is not that we don't know, but we don't know how to bring ourselves to do that thing.

The solution is [[Boredom]]. The solution and the problem are the same thing.

Our brain interprets things from a comparison point of view. Like when we turn the light on in the middle of the night and it's blinding and or when we are in the sun and suddenly enter the house it takes some time to adjust.

So go to a room with nothing in it that can be entertaining for a while.

Our brain hates being bored, so we need to do some [[Environment Conditioning]] to adjust our spaces to have less entertaining things.
