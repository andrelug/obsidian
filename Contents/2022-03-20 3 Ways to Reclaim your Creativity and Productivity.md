Nowadays it's easier than ever the succeed being a creative professional. We can self-publish and succeed without the need for [[Gate-keepers]] and the time from idea to publishing is the quickest it has ever been.

How can we take advantage of this:

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: The robots are coming

AI can already do the tasks of most junior designers. This means not that we are being completely replaced, but rather that we need different skills as designers.

For us to have a place in this future, we need to dream a future that is:
- Bold
- Ridiculous
- Unexpected

And we have to bring our human touch to everything we do. As humans, we can express love and emotions and connect the dots when machines can only work within its boundaries.

### Challenge 2: We should be innovating, not iterating

Most industries are being disrupted by new technologies and services, but how do we prepare for that?

We have to think really big and use to feel uncomfortable. As we grow older we become risk averse instead of risk takers. And this makes us think small.

### Challenge 3: We're distracted all the time

In the modern work environment, an average person gets distracted every 90 seconds. And we get about 3.5h of productive time per day.

Multitasking is a myth.

Because of that, we end up anxious and stressed, getting closers to burn-out all the time.

## Tools to help us

### 1 Focus sprints

A [[Focus spring]] is a 90 minute chunk of time of uninterrupted focus work. Here you can achieve peak performance

1. Prepare the environment
2. Assign a goal for the sprint
3. Set a timer for 90 minutes and go
4. Rest for 30 minutes
	1. Like go to walk is good
	2. No tech
5. Repeat

### 2 Better brainstorms "expansive thinking"

[[Brainstorm]] sessions are normally not very productive and drain everybody's energy because the idea was unclear.

To run a proper brainstorm session
1. Set a very specific goal for the session
2. Break-up the room into 4 people max groups
	1. 1 facilitates the process and the other 3 participate
3. Invite a 'naÃ¯ve expert' - someone from a different department or area to bring more ideas to the table
4. Play hot potato with the idea
	1. You can't disregard any idea at this point
	2. Use the language: "Yes, and ..." 
5. Document the idea on a sheet of paper both with images and text

### 3 Beautiful boredom

When we're children we had many bored moments, where we were able to just let our imagination fly and come up with tons of interesting ideas, stories and more.

We need to give undistracted moments to our brain. Focused, but not with a clear goal in mind, moments.

1. Turn off all stimuli
2. Be bored
3. Let your mind wonder
4. Document it on a physical pen and paper
