Sometimes it's very difficult to focus in something important. It's hard. Then we procrastinate.

Our brain is the same as our hunter-gatherer ancestors. There weren't many exciting things, so we released [[Dopamine]] whenever we found food or had something interesting to make.

Dopamine is what controls our motivation, we also release it when we get a new notification on the smartphone. But now our lives are completely full of stimulating things. Where everything is designed to be as pleasurable as humanly possible. This is called [[Super-normal stimuli]]. And it hijacks our natural reward pathways so that some things are treated like very important for our survival considering the amount of dopamine released. Like junk-food.

Boring (normal) things become almost painful to do.

When we see something that gave us a lot of dopamine in the past, we go towards that in the future. We become slaves to our dopamine. We prefer the super-normal artificial rewards than the 'normal' and 'natural' rewards we have in regular things in live.

So we need to reprogram our brain.

Here it's important to reduce the amount of stimuli, not for a short period, like a [[Dopamine fasting]], but for good. This will help us find more enjoyment in life from the small things and overall, without the need to constantly search for stimuli all the time.
