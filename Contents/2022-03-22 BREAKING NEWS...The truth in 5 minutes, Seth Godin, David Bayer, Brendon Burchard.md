The internet gave everyone a microphone - a voice -, which is a good thing as voices previously unheard, now are. But also it got us a problem, which was the creation of [[Chambers of noise]].

People and media started creating breaking news that isn't breaking and creating an environment of fake news, bad news and worry.

>> So we can't discount how hard the media worked against all of our peace of mind and wellbeing for the last 15 or 20 years.
>> ~ Seth Godin

We become unaware of how many stories and bad scripts are in our head all day long.

So we need to explore ourselves deep to understand what truly is going on in our minds.

The only way we can grow and progress is by being clear on what this success is for us and make sure that what we believe is congruent with that outcome. If not, we are working against ourselves.

We see the world around us and we make a story about it, not the other way around.

If we do a certain activity, like helping others, this becomes the kind of activity we admire. Not the other way around.

If we want to do something, just do it because this will change how we think about us and our work.

Every morning we decide if we are just going to pass by and let the day go through or if we are going to be clear on our goals and fight for them. And most people don't make that conscience decision.
