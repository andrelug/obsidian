Fairly often we find ourselves in a situation that there is so much to do that is hard to wrap our heads around things. We feel overwhelmed.

In these cases, there is a way to sort things out:

1. Have a process
2. Trust the process

Have a step by step process that guide us towards the end goal. We don't get distracted by the end result, but rather focus on each step at a time.

## Process
1. Get all in front of you - list all things in the head
	1. Identify the most short term things
2. Plan 1-3 days ahead - manageable days, not impossible days
	1. Some step forward, no matter how small
	2. Start building up [[Momentum]]
3. Plan the next 3-4 days

This will get things moving and deal with the short term. Then you'll have the ability and focus to think about the long term.

1. List and prioritize your [[Goals]]
	1. All goals to make big progress - short and long
2. List and prioritize you [[Habits]] and [[Routines]]
3. List and prioritize top Projects that will help us get to where we want to go

After that, you will be able to plan your days better and organize the time to make real progress.

Trust the process! Most important thing
