There is a term called [[Growth mindset]] is an important one and many people are now talking about it.

A fixed mindset tells we are only as intelligent as we are right now.

A growth mindset describes the believe we can grow, change and improve.

People with growth mindsets try new things, are not afraid to fail or experience setbacks, and explore new possibilities.

>> The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it's not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives
>> ~ [[@ Dr Carol Dwek]]

How to cultivate a growth mindset:

## 1

**Stop worrying about if you're smart enough and start worrying if you're working hard enough**

What matters is to get the job done, not how smart we perceive ourselves. No need to judge.

## 2

**Reframe failures as learning opportunities**

No need to see failure as a negative thing that will make us feel bad. What can we do to make it better next time?

## 3

**Reframe setbacks as part of the process**

Setbacks, failures, disappointments and frustrations are 100% natural.

## 4

**Praise effort rather than outcomes**

>> After seven experiments with hundreds of children, we had some of the clearest findings I've ever seen: Praising children's intelligence harms their motivation and it harms their performance. How can that be? Don't children love to be praised? Yes, children love praise. And they especially love to be praised for their intelligence and talent. It really does give them a boost, a special glow - but only for the moment. The minute they hit a snag, their confidence goes out the window and their motivation hits rock bottom. If success means they're smart, then failure means they're dumb. That's the fixed mindset. [[Parenting]]

## 5

**Don't be afraid to ask questions**

Don't be afraid about how others will perceive your intelligence when asking questions.

True [[Self-confidence]] is the courage to be open, to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source.

## 6

**Take on new challenges**

We can learn and be anything we want.

We can start with something smaller and grow from there.
