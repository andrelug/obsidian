To achieve your goals, you must become a master at [[Visualization]]

Visualization is a great skill. Mel Robbins calls the power of manifesting or the secret 'Seeing signs'.

Our brain has a system called [[Reticular activating system]], which is a filter system that allows some information to go through and others not to.

This system confirms our beliefs as it has been programed by our experiences and past.

It looks to evidence all day long of our self-talk. It's responsible for the [[Confirmation-bias]].

We have this system because we are constantly bombarded with information. This systems helps us not take everything at equal value and focus on some of the things.

But it tends to only let in stuff we agreed and believe.

### How we reprogram the reticular activating system

We need to reprogram this system so our brains can start spotting opportunities, evidences that things are working out, coincidences, etc.

It begins with visualization.

After we set our goals, we make a visualization session. We want to visualize how we want our lives to be like and feel when our self-worth is improved.

To visualize:
1. Close your eyes
2. In your mind, have a specific vision in the day-to-day life when you have achieve your goal
3. Consciously think about the emotions you are going to have when being successful

When you do this, you are changing the filter.

Our brain doesn't know the difference between what is actually happening and a imagined reality we are creating.

When we visualize, we encode a real memory on our brain. And the more we do it, the more the reticular activating system comprehend this new reality. Not to mention that we get all the benefits of feeling good from our imagined accomplishments.

Visualization takes 30 seconds!
