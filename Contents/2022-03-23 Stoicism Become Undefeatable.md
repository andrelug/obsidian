>> We suffer more in imagination than in reality
>> ~ [[@ Seneca]]

Zeno, the father of Stoicism, lost everything after a natural disaster, but instead of feeling angry, sad, injustice, etc, he had in mind the core of this philosophy: **acceptance and indifference**.

According to Zeno, although we don't have much control over what happens to us, we do have control of how it affects us (how we react to those things), and we must use this control to great effect. [[Dichotomy of control]]

Stoics are viewed as people who cannot be broken, who don't often linger to the emotional extremes, going through things like fits of rage or bouts of anxiety. But the original idea behind stoicism is more than that. [[Emotional spectrum]]

Rather than a way to describe people who are unemotional, Stoicism was a way to view, describe and understand the world. A way of life.

It's a way to process the negative emotions from negative experiences and turn them into the thoughts that give us an unique perspective of the world.

Perspective is everything.

Stoicism teaches that we should expect that everything bad that can happen, will happen. Picture the worst outcome and be content knowing it could happen.

A Stoic exercise is [[Voluntary discomfort]], which aims to increase feelings of gratitude.
- Act in a way that will give you discomfort
	- Sleep on the floor of your kitchen
	- Take cold showers
	- Eat nothing but potatoes for a few days

This exercise helps us to understand that no matter how hard it gets, we'll still survive and potentially thrive if our [[Mindset]] is right. We prepare our mind for future misfortunes.

There are many cultural messages nowadays that tell us that we will only be happy if we look a certain way, have money, buy something, etc. And we set our expectations from what we learn from our families, school and society. With that in mind, we end up setting unrealistic expectations for ourselves and feeling ultimately disappointed and unsatisfied.

We should instead focus on improving ourselves, for ourselves. Not doing things for their external values - to please or change others - but for our internal values - [[Growth]] and [[Learning]]

So instead of putting our happiness depended on external forces, which can fail.

>> Learning to live with less will create space in your life for the things that truly matter to you.
>> ~ Seneca

We need to separate the things we can control from the things we can't and focus our energy on those we can control.

Breakdown when things don't go our way is 'useless'.

We should judge our work based on the effort we put in and not the outcome of our external hopes for the work.

When uploading a video on YouTube we can do the video, but we can't control how it will spread.

Four main virtues of stoicism:
1. Wisdom
	1. Be able to separate what is internal and external and to chose our reaction to the things that happen to us.
2. Courage
	1. Persist and resist
3. Temperance
	1. Do more with less. Say more with less words.
	2. The limit of wealth is simply having what is essential and having what is enough
4. Justice
	1. The most important
	2. We shouldn't do harm to others

>>Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response.
>>~ [[@ Viktor Frankl]]

Everything is a process. And everything has an end.
