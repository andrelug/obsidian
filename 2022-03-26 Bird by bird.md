## Summary

## Chapter 2

Becoming a good writer means writing about everything that happens to you and around you.

While there‚Äôs no secret formula to becoming a good writer, there are some essential steps. The first step is learning how to relax, stand apart from people and observe closely. You know the kind of people you notice standing in the corner at a party, watching everyone? Good writers are a similar breed: they often choose to distance themselves from the crowd, observing everything they see, and take notes.

The writer‚Äôs job is to articulate what she sees and experiences. This requires an ability to relax and focus so that nothing escapes her notice. It‚Äôs important not to rush the process, or force anything. In other words, **you have to learn to pay attention**. Take time to observe everything around you: the curious gait of a stranger, the unique way the morning light catches a lover‚Äôs profile, how thinking about a childhood memory makes you feel. There‚Äôs another reason that observing and noting your world is critical in becoming a good writer. **The best writing is about conveying the truth**; the observations you collect will help you to tell it. Whether you believe that your observations will make good material isn‚Äôt important. Your main task is to try to find the truth in what you‚Äôve observed, and figure out how to use those observations in the story you want to tell. That way, the truth will naturally find its way into your writing. Don‚Äôt be afraid to draw on past experiences as your main material. For example, take the time to reflect on and write about childhood and other memories. After all, as a writer, you‚Äôre lucky enough to look at life in any way you want to. You can turn over events in your memory like fallow earth, digging for the truth that is buried deep within them. Taking a trip into your own memory bank is justified as long as you make sure to look carefully and write from your own viewpoint as truthfully as you can. Thus you need to examine your self in the same way you examine everything around you.

## Chapter 3

To find your own voice, you have to be honest with your reader.

If there‚Äôs one thing critics agree on when it comes to defining a great writer, it‚Äôs that the writer has a ‚Äúvoice‚Äù ‚Äì a unique style that includes not only the details of a story but also how it is told. The only way you can develop your own voice is by being honest with the reader about your true feelings. **You cannot discover your authentic voice without opening some emotional doors and facing the truths behind them**. That is your main role as a writer: to discover and confront whatever feelings those doors are hiding and to articulate them in words that reflect the truth of your feelings.

This principle holds true even when you‚Äôre feeling profound grief or toxic anger. The only way to ensure your voice reflects those emotions is to face them and accept them during the writing process. You need to do this especially when you feel something holding your words back: for instance, if your feelings are too private or too painful to examine closely. To accept your feelings you have to be present in them ‚Äì in other words, to be fully aware of how you feel at any given moment. If you avoid your emotions, or if you merely think about them without fully entering and being present in them, you‚Äôll never be true to yourself or your voice. When you are present in your feelings, you come to understand that your reality ‚Äì made of all your experiences and emotions, both good and bad ‚Äì is very much your home. It‚Äôs a comfortable place to be, and you can be your true self there. Once you accept this, you‚Äôll begin to feel comfortable with yourself and the full spectrum of your emotions ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be on your way to finding your own writer‚Äôs voice.

## Chapter 4

Have faith in your ability to write, even when you think you‚Äôre not doing a great job.

Another thing that all good writers have in common is that they don‚Äôt worry about whether they‚Äôre good writers! If you believe with every fiber of your being that you should write, just write. With time and practice, you‚Äôll eventually become good at it. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy. There will be miserable days where you‚Äôll stare at a blank page for hours. But there will also be days when everything clicks and the words just flow. The main thing to remember is that every day has something to offer, if you‚Äôre patient and determined enough to see it.

For young writers, this kind of faith is useful. Even though you may not be a good writer from the start, you may become good one day if you persist. Along the way, you may also develop a real yearning for the act of writing, the same way that someone might yearn to play sports or music. By having faith that you‚Äôll become a good writer, the frustration of not writing as brilliantly as you believe you can will be replaced by the sheer love of the act itself. Another way that faith is crucial to writing is that writers have to believe in their position ‚Äì whatever they‚Äôre writing about. **If you don‚Äôt believe in your words, nobody will**. How do you generate such belief? Make an effort to understand life, and to care about it, as deeply as you can. That entails also taking a long, hard look at the banalities of life and not just the big, dramatic events. Write about everything that‚Äôs important to you. Only then will you feel connected with your story and be able to find the right words to describe it.

## Chapter 5

To become a good writer, establish a daily writing routine. [[Routines]]

A common assumption about writers, and all artists, is that they work only when inspiration strikes. Yet all good writers follow a strict routine. If you want to become a better writer, you should do the same. Why? Because routine means discipline, and discipline means success. First, find a place to write and go there every single day, even if you‚Äôre not always productive. Second, go to your place to write around the same time every day. By doing this, you ensure that your unconscious mind is ready to yield creatively when you arrive. When you first establish this process, you might feel a little bored and perhaps won‚Äôt be able to do any writing at all. Eventually you‚Äôll notice your routine is having a positive effect. You‚Äôll begin to clear a mental ‚Äúwriting space‚Äù to prepare yourself for the creative work necessary to good writing.

The idea behind the routine is to make writing a daily habit. Though there‚Äôll be times when you struggle to write, your routine will train your [[Creativity]] energies to kick in at the right time every day. However, even routine and discipline won‚Äôt necessarily make you a great writer. Remember: there‚Äôs simply no secret formula to writing well. Yet it‚Äôs crucial to understand just how important commitment is to your work. Commitment, along with routine and discipline, is essential to your success as a writer. The author admits that no secret was passed down through her family to help her to write well. She was given no password that allowed her to ‚Äúcrack the code‚Äù of good writing. Rather, by thinking about all the good writers she knew, the author came to realize that they were all incredibly committed to their work and disciplined about their routine. Writing is very similar to meditation: you have to quiet your mind so you can hear your inner voice. Establishing a daily routine, and sticking to it religiously, makes this possible. So far, you‚Äôve seen what it takes to become a good writer. In the following blinks, you‚Äôll learn all about the steps involved in writing a book.

## Chapter 6

Don‚Äôt be afraid of shitty first drafts.

Many people think that good writing springs fully formed from the writer‚Äôs imagination. If you‚Äôve ever written even a college paper, you‚Äôll know this isn‚Äôt true: nobody writes an elegant first draft. All good books are the end result of a series of increasingly good versions, beginning with the roughest formulation of one‚Äôs ideas ‚Äì or, as the author calls it, the ‚Äú**shitty first draft**.‚Äù Even the most seasoned writer can find it difficult to accept how poor their writing is at this stage. It‚Äôs important, though, that all writers not only accept the shitty first draft as merely a point of departure, but also embrace this stage of the process.

The shitty first draft is the perfect opportunity for you to let your imagination wander and play with ideas. Don‚Äôt overthink your writing at this stage ‚Äì just write. Thinking too much can be counterproductive, blocking your creativity and frustrating you to the point that you may even give up. Instead, enjoy it! The first draft is where you can get dirty, rolling in your own mud, freed by the knowledge that you can clean up the mess later. No one can judge you by your first draft, so just use it to dump everything you have onto the page. Once you‚Äôve produced that shitty first draft, you can begin to edit: the process of developing your piece, refining its focus and improving the writing. Consider the second draft as the ‚Äúup‚Äù draft, because you‚Äôre fixing it UP. Think of the third draft as the ‚Äúdental‚Äù draft, because it involves poking and prodding at the writing in the same way that a dentist examines your mouth, checking the condition of each and every tooth. A good way to think of the whole process is to imagine you‚Äôre watching a story reveal itself through successive drafts, like watching a Polaroid picture slowly develop.


## Chapter 7

Get to know your [[Story Characters]] well; your [[Story Plot]] and dialogue flows through them.

Every good story has memorable characters, and every aspiring writer wants to know how to create them. So how do you create unforgettable characters? To create great characters, you have to get to know them. Then, once you understand them, your job as a writer is to bring them to life. How?

**Every character, like every real person, owns an emotional acre**. Think of it as a space where everything that makes up your personality ‚Äì your wants, hates, needs and loves ‚Äì grows or develops. In your story, it‚Äôs important to get a sense of each character‚Äôs emotional acre. Ask yourself: What is my character growing on his acre? What is blooming, what is dying? What condition is the land in? Next, take a more detailed look: What are your characters doing? What happens to them?

**You can‚Äôt be too protective of your characters.** You have to let bad things happen to them. If they live an ideal existence and behave flawlessly, your story will be mundane and flat ‚Äì like everyday life. Finally, you have to find the voice of your characters. One way to do this is to model a character‚Äôs personality on someone you know in real life, as this will give your character a ‚Äútrue voice.‚Äù This is essential because ‚Äì as readers ‚Äì we want to believe that fictional characters are telling us the truth. Bringing characters to life also means allowing plot and dialogue to emerge from them. To do this you have to understand them. From this understanding, your plot and dialogue will develop naturally. Consider how your characters would talk to each other in various settings ‚Äì like on a train or at the mall. Come up with challenging situations for them, and imagine how they would react.

**Remember that dialogue can reveal more about a character than a lengthy description**. This doesn‚Äôt refer only to what characters say, but also how they say it ‚Äì their diction, pace and speaking style. Finally, to create good dialogue, read it aloud to check how realistic it sounds and pay attention to how real people talk. Listen closely ‚Äì are they using their words correctly? What distinguishes the way they speak?

## Chapter 8

Pay attention to details to create the atmosphere of your story.

If you‚Äôve ever been engrossed in a novel, you know how important details are to storytelling. Because details make a story more tangible and believable, a writer uses details to bring a reader ‚Äúinside‚Äù her story. **One important detail is your story‚Äôs setting**. A good setting can bring your story to life, making the world of your characters more three-dimensional. As a writer, you have the ability to tailor any setting to fit your story and characters. For instance, a forest setting in which a crime occurs will certainly be depicted using more sinister, darker details than a sunny, verdant forest in which a happy family has an afternoon picnic. The private settings of characters can reveal much about them, too. The character‚Äôs relationship with his space can illuminate certain aspects of his personality. For example, if a character spends his days idly wandering through his enormous house, this might suggest he‚Äôs a wealthy man. Great details can make themselves known at any time, so a good writer keeps her eyes open and carries a notebook at all times to jot down details that may come in handy when writing. But just what sort of details? If you‚Äôre at a grandiose mansion for an event, for example, note how many steps there are on the main staircase, or figure out how long it takes to walk from one end of the mansion to the other. Then you can make your wealthy character‚Äôs lonely ramblings real.

Attending to details can help mold the structure of your story. Often, when a writer wants to check that his narrative or plot flows well, he‚Äôll write a [[Plot treatment]] ‚Äì a detailed list of everything that happens in each chapter of the book. When you produce a treatment, any missing details or illogical bits of your story will become obvious to you. For example, if a character dies in the first chapter but returns to save the day in the last, you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôve got a problem ‚Äì unless, of course, you‚Äôre writing about zombies. Shitty first drafts, memorable characters and vivid details can help you to write well. But what happens when you hit an obstacle in the writing process?
